# Customer-Response-Model-Explainability

## 🧠 ML Model Monitoring & Explainability Toolkit

This project demonstrates a robust, end-to-end workflow for building, validating, and interpreting machine learning models with a strong focus on transparency and production-readiness.

It includes four modular notebooks:

- 🔧 **Feature Engineering**
- 📉 **Data and Model Drift Detection**
- 📊 **Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)**
- 🧾 **LIME & SHAP Explainability**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in real-world environments, ensuring that they remain stable, explainable, and compliant is essential. This project provides a streamlined approach to:

- Creating high-quality features that improve model performance and generalization
- Monitoring data pipelines for drift to avoid silent model decay
- Interpreting complex models globally (PDP) and locally (LIME, SHAP)
- Building trust with stakeholders through visual and quantitative explainability
